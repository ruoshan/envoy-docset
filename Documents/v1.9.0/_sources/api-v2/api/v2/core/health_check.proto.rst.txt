.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.timeout:

timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The time to wait for a health check response. If the timeout is reached the
  health check attempt will be considered a failure.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.interval:

interval
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The interval between health checks.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.interval_jitter:

interval_jitter
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) An optional jitter amount in millseconds. If specified, during every
  interval Envoy will add interval_jitter to the wait time.

  (`uint32 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) An optional jitter amount as a percentage of interval_ms. If specified,
  during every interval Envoy will add interval_ms *
  interval_jitter_percent / 100 to the wait time.
  
  If interval_jitter_ms and interval_jitter_percent are both set, both of
  them will be used to increase the wait time.

healthy_threshold
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) The number of healthy health checks required before a host is marked
  healthy. Note that during startup, only a single successful health check is
  required to mark a host healthy.
  
  

.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.reuse_connection:

reuse_connection
  (`BoolValue <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#boolvalue>`_) Reuse health check connection between health checks. Default is true.

.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.no_traffic_interval:

no_traffic_interval
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The "no traffic interval" is a special health check interval that is used when a cluster has
  never had traffic routed to it. This lower interval allows cluster information to be kept up to
  date, without sending a potentially large amount of active health checking traffic for no
  reason. Once a cluster has been used for traffic routing, Envoy will shift back to using the
  standard health check interval that is defined. Note that this interval takes precedence over
  any other.
  
  The default value for "no traffic interval" is 60 seconds.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.unhealthy_interval:

unhealthy_interval
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The "unhealthy interval" is a health check interval that is used for hosts that are marked as
  unhealthy. As soon as the host is marked as healthy, Envoy will shift back to using the
  standard health check interval that is defined.
  
  The default value for "unhealthy interval" is the same as "interval".
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.unhealthy_edge_interval:

unhealthy_edge_interval
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The "unhealthy edge interval" is a special health check interval that is used for the first
  health check right after a host is marked as unhealthy. For subsequent health checks
  Envoy will shift back to using either "unhealthy interval" if present or the standard health
  check interval that is defined.
  
  The default value for "unhealthy edge interval" is the same as "unhealthy interval".
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.healthy_edge_interval:

healthy_edge_interval
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The "healthy edge interval" is a special health check interval that is used for the first
  health check right after a host is marked as healthy. For subsequent health checks
  Envoy will shift back to using the standard health check interval that is defined.
  
  The default value for "healthy edge interval" is the same as the default interval.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.event_log_path:

event_log_path
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Specifies the path to the :ref:`health check event log <arch_overview_health_check_logging>`.

always_log_health_check_failures
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) If set to true, health check failure events will always be logged. If set to false, only the
  initial health check failure event will be logged.
  The default value is false.
