Aggregated Discovery Service (ADS)
==================================


This documentation is for the Envoy v3 API.

As of Envoy v1.18 the v2 API has been removed and is no longer supported.

If you are upgrading from v2 API config you may wish to view the v2 API documentation:

    :ref:`service/discovery/v2/ads.proto <v1.17.2:envoy_api_file_envoy/service/discovery/v2/ads.proto>`




Discovery services for endpoints, clusters, routes,
and listeners are retained in the package `envoy.api.v2` for backwards
compatibility with existing management servers. New development in discovery
services should proceed in the package `envoy.service.discovery.v2`.
