Dynamic forward proxy common configuration
==========================================


This documentation is for the Envoy v3 API.

As of Envoy v1.18 the v2 API has been removed and is no longer supported.

If you are upgrading from v2 API config you may wish to view the v2 API documentation:

    :ref:`config/common/dynamic_forward_proxy/v2alpha/dns_cache.proto <v1.17.2:envoy_api_file_envoy/config/common/dynamic_forward_proxy/v2alpha/dns_cache.proto>`

:repo:`[extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheCircuitBreakers proto] <api/envoy/extensions/common/dynamic_forward_proxy/v3/dns_cache.proto#L24>`

Configuration of circuit breakers for resolver.

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheCircuitBreakers.max_pending_requests:

max_pending_requests
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) The maximum number of pending requests that Envoy will allow to the
  resolver. If not specified, the default is 1024.

:repo:`[extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig proto] <api/envoy/extensions/common/dynamic_forward_proxy/v3/dns_cache.proto#L33>`

Configuration for the dynamic forward proxy DNS cache. See the :ref:`architecture overview

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.name:

name
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The name of the cache. Multiple named caches allow independent dynamic forward proxy
  configurations to operate within a single Envoy process using different configurations. All
  configurations with the same name *must* otherwise have the same settings when referenced
  from different configuration components. Configuration will fail to load if this is not
  the case.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_lookup_family:

dns_lookup_family
  (:ref:`config.cluster.v3.Cluster.DnsLookupFamily <envoy_v3_api_enum_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.DnsLookupFamily>`) The DNS lookup family to use during resolution.
  
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_refresh_rate:

dns_refresh_rate
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The DNS refresh rate for currently cached DNS hosts. If not specified defaults to 60s.
  
  .. note:
  
   The returned DNS TTL is not currently used to alter the refresh rate. This feature will be
   added in a future change.
  
  .. note:
  
  The refresh rate is rounded to the closest millisecond, and must be at least 1ms.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.host_ttl:

host_ttl
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The TTL for hosts that are unused. Hosts that have not been used in the configured time
  interval will be purged. If not specified defaults to 5m.
  
  .. note:
  
    The TTL is only checked at the time of DNS refresh, as specified by *dns_refresh_rate*. This
    means that if the configured TTL is shorter than the refresh rate the host may not be removed
    immediately.
  
   .. note:
  
    The TTL has no relation to DNS TTL and is only used to control Envoy's resource usage.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.max_hosts:

max_hosts
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) The maximum number of hosts that the cache will hold. If not specified defaults to 1024.
  
  .. note:
  
    The implementation is approximate and enforced independently on each worker thread, thus
    it is possible for the maximum hosts in the cache to go slightly above the configured
    value depending on timing. This is similar to how other circuit breakers work.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_failure_refresh_rate:

dns_failure_refresh_rate
  (:ref:`config.cluster.v3.Cluster.RefreshRate <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.cluster.v3.Cluster.RefreshRate>`) If the DNS failure refresh rate is specified,
  this is used as the cache's DNS refresh rate when DNS requests are failing. If this setting is
  not specified, the failure refresh rate defaults to the dns_refresh_rate.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_cache_circuit_breaker:

dns_cache_circuit_breaker
  (:ref:`extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheCircuitBreakers <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheCircuitBreakers>`) The config of circuit breakers for resolver. It provides a configurable threshold.
  Envoy will use dns cache circuit breakers with default settings even if this value is not set.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.use_tcp_for_dns_lookups:

use_tcp_for_dns_lookups
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Always use TCP queries instead of UDP queries for DNS lookups.
  Setting this value causes failure if the
  ``envoy.restart_features.use_apple_api_for_dns_lookups`` runtime value is true during
  server startup. Apple' API only uses UDP for DNS resolution.
  This field is deprecated in favor of *dns_resolution_config*
  which aggregates all of the DNS resolver configuration in a single message.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_resolution_config:

dns_resolution_config
  (:ref:`config.core.v3.DnsResolutionConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.DnsResolutionConfig>`) DNS resolution configuration which includes the underlying dns resolver addresses and options.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.preresolve_hostnames:

preresolve_hostnames
  (**repeated** :ref:`config.core.v3.SocketAddress <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.SocketAddress>`) Hostnames that should be preresolved into the cache upon creation. This might provide a
  performance improvement, in the form of cache hits, for hostnames that are going to be
  resolved during steady state and are known at config load time.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.common.dynamic_forward_proxy.v3.DnsCacheConfig.dns_query_timeout:

dns_query_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The timeout used for DNS queries. This timeout is independent of any timeout and retry policy
  used by the underlying DNS implementation (e.g., c-areas and Apple DNS) which are opaque.
  Setting this timeout will ensure that queries succeed or fail within the specified time frame
  and are then retried using the standard refresh rates. Defaults to 5s if not set.
