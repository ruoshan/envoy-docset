1.5.0 (December 4, 2017)
========================

Changes
-------

* access log: added fields for :ref:`UPSTREAM_LOCAL_ADDRESS and DOWNSTREAM_ADDRESS
  <config_access_log_format>`.
* admin: added :ref:`JSON output <operations_admin_interface_stats>` for stats admin endpoint.
* admin: added basic :ref:`Prometheus output <operations_admin_interface_stats>` for stats admin
  endpoint. Histograms are not currently output.
* admin: added ``version_info`` to the :ref:`/clusters admin endpoint<operations_admin_interface_clusters>`.
* config: the :ref:`v2 API <config_overview>` is now considered production ready.
* config: added --v2-config-only CLI flag.
* cors: added :ref:`CORS filter <config_http_filters_cors>`.
* health check: added :ref:`x-envoy-immediate-health-check-fail
  <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-immediate-health-check-fail>` header support.
* health check: added :ref:`reuse_connection <envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.reuse_connection>` option.
* http: added :ref:`per-listener stats <config_http_conn_man_stats_per_listener>`.

* load balancer: added ring size and hash :ref:`configuration options
  <envoy_api_msg_Cluster.RingHashLbConfig>`. This used to be configurable via runtime. The runtime
  configuration was deleted without deprecation as we are fairly certain no one is using it.

  See :ref:`deprecated log <deprecated>`
  for outlier detection stats deprecations in this release.
* redis: the :ref:`redis proxy filter <config_network_filters_redis_proxy>` is now considered
  production ready.
* redis: added :ref:`"drain close" <arch_overview_draining>` functionality.
* router: added :ref:`x-envoy-overloaded <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-overloaded_set>` support.
* router: added :ref:`regex <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.regex>` route matching.

  to create child span for egress calls.

  <config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers>` of request/response headers.

  <envoy_api_field_route.RedirectAction.response_code>`.
* router: added :ref:`configuration <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster_not_found_response_code>`
  to return either a 404 or 503 if the upstream cluster does not exist.
* runtime: added :ref:`comment capability <config_runtime_comments>`.
* server: change default log level (:option:`-l`) to `info`.

* tcp proxy: added :ref:`configurable connect retries
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.tcp_proxy.v2.TcpProxy.max_connect_attempts>`.
* tcp proxy: enable use of :ref:`outlier detector <arch_overview_outlier_detection>`.
* tls: added :ref:`SNI support <faq_how_to_setup_sni>`.
* tls: added support for specifying :ref:`TLS session ticket keys
  <envoy_api_field_auth.DownstreamTlsContext.session_ticket_keys>`.
* tls: allow configuration of the :ref:`min
  <envoy_api_field_auth.TlsParameters.tls_minimum_protocol_version>` and :ref:`max
  <envoy_api_field_auth.TlsParameters.tls_maximum_protocol_version>` TLS protocol versions.
* tracing: added :ref:`custom trace span decorators <envoy_api_field_route.Route.decorator>`.
* Many small bug fixes and performance improvements not listed.

Deprecated
----------

* The outlier detection `ejections_total` stats counter has been deprecated and not replaced. Monitor
  the individual `ejections_detected_*` counters for the detectors of interest, or
  `ejections_enforced_total` for the total number of ejections that actually occurred.
* The outlier detection `ejections_consecutive_5xx` stats counter has been deprecated in favour of
  `ejections_detected_consecutive_5xx` and `ejections_enforced_consecutive_5xx`.
* The outlier detection `ejections_success_rate` stats counter has been deprecated in favour of
  `ejections_detected_success_rate` and `ejections_enforced_success_rate`.
