This extension may be referenced by the qualified name *envoy.resource_monitors.injected_resource*

.. note::
  This extension is functional but has not had substantial production burn time, use only with this caveat.

  This extension does not operate on the data plane and hence is intended to be robust against untrusted traffic.

The injected resource monitor allows injecting a synthetic resource pressure into Envoy
via a text file, which must contain a floating-point number in the range [0..1] representing
the resource pressure and be updated atomically by a symbolic link swap.
This is intended primarily for integration tests to force Envoy into an overloaded state.
