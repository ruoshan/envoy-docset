This extension may be referenced by the qualified name *envoy.filters.http.cdn_loop*

.. note::
  This extension is functional but has not had substantial production burn time, use only with this caveat.

  This extension has an unknown security posture and should only be used in deployments where both the downstream and upstream are trusted.

.. warning::
   This API is work-in-progress and is subject to breaking changes.

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.cdn_loop.v3alpha.CdnLoopConfig.cdn_id:

cdn_id
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The CDN identifier to use for loop checks and to append to the
  CDN-Loop header.
  
  RFC 8586 calls this the cdn-id. The cdn-id can either be a
  pseudonym or hostname the CDN is in control of.
  
  cdn_id must not be empty.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.cdn_loop.v3alpha.CdnLoopConfig.max_allowed_occurrences:

max_allowed_occurrences
  (`uint32 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) The maximum allowed count of cdn_id in the downstream CDN-Loop
  request header.
  
  The default of 0 means a request can transit the CdnLoopFilter
  once. A value of 1 means that a request can transit the
  CdnLoopFilter twice and so on.
