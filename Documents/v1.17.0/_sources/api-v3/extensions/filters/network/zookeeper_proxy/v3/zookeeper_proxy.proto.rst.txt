max_packet_bytes
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) Messages — requests, responses and events — that are bigger than this value will
  be ignored. If it is not set, the default value is 1Mb.
  
  The value here should match the jute.maxbuffer property in your cluster configuration:
