=============================================================

This extension may be referenced by the qualified name ``envoy.formatter.req_without_query``

.. note::
  This extension is functional but has not had substantial production burn time, use only with this caveat.

  This extension is intended to be robust against both untrusted downstream and upstream traffic.

.. tip::
  This extension extends and can be used with the following extension category:


  - :ref:`envoy.formatter <extension_category_envoy.formatter>`



ReqWithoutQuery formatter extension implements REQ_WITHOUT_QUERY command operator that
works the same way as :ref:`REQ <config_access_log_format_req>` except that it will
remove the query string. It is used to avoid logging any sensitive information into
the access log.
See :ref:`here <config_access_log>` for more information on access log configuration.


%REQ_WITHOUT_QUERY(X?Y):Z%
  An HTTP request header where X is the main HTTP header, Y is the alternative one, and Z is an
  optional parameter denoting string truncation up to Z characters long. The value is taken from
  the HTTP request header named X first and if it's not set, then request header Y is used. If
  none of the headers are present '-' symbol will be in the log.
