This extension may be referenced by the qualified name ``envoy.filters.http.ext_proc``

.. note::
  This extension is functional but has not had substantial production burn time, use only with this caveat.

  This extension has an unknown security posture and should only be used in deployments where both the downstream and upstream are trusted.

.. tip::
  This extension extends and can be used with the following extension category:


  - :ref:`envoy.filters.http <extension_category_envoy.filters.http>`

.. warning::
   This API feature is currently work-in-progress. API features marked as work-in-progress are not considered stable, are not covered by the :ref:`threat model <arch_overview_threat_model>`, are not supported by the security team, and are subject to breaking changes. Do not use this feature without understanding each of the previous points.

External Processing Filter


The External Processing filter allows an external service to act on HTTP traffic in a flexible way.


**Current Implementation Status:**
All options and processing modes are implemented except for the following:

* Request and response attributes are not sent and not processed.
* Dynamic metadata in responses from the external processor is ignored.
* "async mode" is not implemented
* Per-route configuration is not implemented


The filter communicates with an external gRPC service called an "external processor"
that can do a variety of things with the request and response:

* Access and modify the HTTP headers on the request, response, or both
* Access and modify the HTTP request and response bodies
* Access and modify the dynamic stream metadata
* Immediately send an HTTP response downstream and terminate other processing

The filter communicates with the server using a gRPC bidirectional stream. After the initial
request, the external server is in control over what additional data is sent to it
and how it should be processed.

By implementing the protocol specified by the stream, the external server can choose:

* Whether it receives the response message at all
* Whether it receives the message body at all, in separate chunks, or as a single buffer
* Whether subsequent HTTP requests are transmitted synchronously or whether they are
  sent asynchronously.
* To modify request or response trailers if they already exist
* To add request or response trailers where they are not present

The filter supports up to six different processing steps. Each is represented by
a gRPC stream message that is sent to the external processor. For each message, the
processor must send a matching response.

* Request headers: Contains the headers from the original HTTP request.
* Request body: Sent in a single message if the BUFFERED or BUFFERED_PARTIAL
  mode is chosen, in multiple messages if the STREAMED mode is chosen, and not
  at all otherwise.
* Request trailers: Delivered if they are present and if the trailer mode is set
  to SEND.
* Response headers: Contains the headers from the HTTP response. Keep in mind
  that if the upstream system sends them before processing the request body that
  this message may arrive before the complete body.
* Response body: Sent according to the processing mode like the request body.
* Response trailers: Delivered according to the processing mode like the
  request trailers.

By default, the processor sends only the request and response headers messages.
This may be changed to include any of the six steps by changing the processing_mode
setting of the filter configuration, or by setting the mode_override of any response
from the external processor. This way, a processor may, for example, use information
in the request header to determine whether the message body must be examined, or whether
the proxy should simply stream it straight through.

All of this together allows a server to process the filter traffic in fairly
sophisticated ways. For example:

* A server may choose to examine all or part of the HTTP message bodies depending
  on the content of the headers.
* A server may choose to immediately reject some messages based on their HTTP
  headers (or other dynamic metadata) and more carefully examine others
* A server may asynchronously monitor traffic coming through the filter by inspecting
  headers, bodies, or both, and then decide to switch to a synchronous processing
  mode, either permanently or temporarily.

The protocol itself is based on a bidirectional gRPC stream. Envoy will send the
server
:ref:`ProcessingRequest <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingRequest>`
messages, and the server must reply with
:ref:`ProcessingResponse <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse>`.

failure_mode_allow
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) By default, if the gRPC stream cannot be established, or if it is closed
  prematurely with an error, the filter will fail. Specifically, if the
  response headers have not yet been delivered, then it will return a 500
  error downstream. If they have been delivered, then instead the HTTP stream to the
  downstream client will be reset.
  With this parameter set to true, however, then if the gRPC stream is prematurely closed
  or could not be opened, processing continues without error.

message_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) Specifies the timeout for each individual message sent on the stream and
  when the filter is running in synchronous mode. Whenever
  the proxy sends a message on the stream that requires a response, it will
  reset this timer, and will stop processing and return an error (subject
  to the processing mode) if the timer expires before a matching response.
  is received. There is no timeout when the filter is running in asynchronous
  mode. Default is 200 milliseconds.
